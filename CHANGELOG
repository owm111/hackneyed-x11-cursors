0.5
- overhaul the artwork entirely
- SVGs now amount to two, one for each variation; individual cursors
  are exported through ids with inkscape
- ditch all but one of the IM hacks

0.4
- text, crosshair: avoid blurry shapes by aligning to pixel boundaries
- pencil, draft: recoloring and reshaping
- pointer, openhand, closedhand: be a bit more anatomically correct, align
  to pixels as well so that the fingers don't look weird
- zoom: make it fully white to stand out more
- zoom-in, zoom-out: change colors
- context-menu: the menu now looks more like a menu
- overall repositioning of overlays because I must have fucked up with
  something

0.3.26
- text, crosshair: more elegant shapes

0.3.24
- make zoom's lens (and consequently zoom-in and zoom-out's) slightly bigger

0.3.23
- swap back col-resize/row-resize, GTK+ applications have fixed themselves

0.3.22
- left-handed versions of openhand, closedhand and pointer

0.3.21.1
- relicense under the MIT/X11 license

0.3.21
- pointer: actually fix the length of the index finger

0.3.20
- soften shadows once again;
- fix the length of the finger in pointer;
- add draped_box;
- widen the stem of text by 1 pixel to avoid blurriness

0.3.19
- added some legacy cursors (based_arrow_*, *_tee, *_angle)

0.3.18
- give some life to draft by coloring it, make pencil look like it;
- make shadows more consistent across pointers, specially the hands;
- change colors of dnd-move's fleur and the question mark in help,
  so they are more noticeable;
- rework the hourglass to make it look better in small sizes;
- wayland-cursor is now a sign of the horns (that was on the previous
  version, but I forgot to write it and I don't quite like historical
  revisionism)

0.3.17
- turn right_ptr into a horizontal arrow pointing right, so
  that it looks distinct in the left-handed theme;
- optimize context-menu to look good in small sizes;
- add draft, wayland-cursor and other arrows, as found in
  the new KDE cursor theme;
- start writing changelogs

0.3.16:
- added dnd-move and dnd-no-drop;
- softened shadows for tcross and xterm/ibeam;
- speaking of tcross, it's less ugly now;
- lots of debugging to figure out where those symlinks should
  really point to. Updates will become less frequent from now on,
  unless a bug is found or someone makes a request

  I want to be cool.
