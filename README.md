Overview
--------

Hackneyed is a reactionary X11 cursor theme created for personal use (like all artwork I do -- or most people, for that matter).
Inspired by old Windows 3.x cursors, Hackneyed brings an old school feel to your wobbly-windowed, docked and blocky desktop of today.

Installation
------------
'make dist' will drop you a tarball with the full theme, including the left-handed one. If you want either the left-
or the right-handed theme, use the targets 'ltheme' or 'theme', respectively. Until the very moment in which these words
are being poured to this world of dread, I had absolutely no feedback on the left-handed theme, so I happily assume I have done
god's work.
