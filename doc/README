WHAT
====
An X11 cursor theme loosely inspired on Windows 3.x cursors.


WHY
===
The lack of spinning hourglasses in today's design trends
for mouse cursors is absolutely revolting.


WHAT DO YOU NEED
================
ImageMagick and xcursorgen (part of the x11-apps package);
just cd to source and 'make'. If everything goes well, you
will be given a tar.bz2 file with the full theme, which will
also remain unpacked in a newly-created 'Hackneyed' folder.


LICENSE
=======
Licensed under the WTFPL. Just do whatever the f... well,
read the full text in LICENSE.


CREDITS
=======
- do-symlinks.sh, rewrite of addmissing.sh, which was taken from
  dummy-x11-cursors by ultr (on kde-look.org)

- some SVGs taken from openclipart.org


BUGS
====
If for whatever reason you like this and want to report a bug,
please do so. I'm a nice guy.

  Mozilla's cursor hashes. If you're wondering about a way to discover them
  without looking in the source code, libXcursor has an undocumented
  "hash logger", which is triggered when one exports a variable called
  XCURSOR_DISCOVER, no matter the value. The hashes are printed on the
  terminal, so it's important that you don't do this from a graphical
  application launcher. The code is in xlib.c, in a function called
  XcursorLogDiscover.

  You should not take into account the hashes for masks, i.e., the filled
  "images" displayed. If for some reason you can't tell a mask from a cursor,
  only consider hashes that "return" some random hex number (something in the
  lines of "Cursor hash XXXXX returns 0xdeadbeef").

  Core X11 cursors. I'm still wondering what most of these cursors are used
  for.
