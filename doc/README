WHAT
====
An X11 cursor theme loosely inspired on Windows 3.x cursors.


WHY
===
The lack of spinning hourglasses in today's design trends
for mouse cursors is absolutely revolting.


WHAT DO YOU NEED
================
ImageMagick and xcursorgen (part of the x11-apps package);
just cd to source and 'make'. If everything goes well, you
will be given a tar.bz2 file with the full theme, which will
also remain unpacked in a newly-created 'Hackneyed' folder.


LICENSE
=======
Licensed under the WTFPL. Just do whatever the f... well,
read the full text in LICENSE.


CREDITS
=======
- do-symlinks.sh, rewrite of addmissing.sh, which was taken from
  dummy-x11-cursors by ultr (on kde-look.org)

- some SVGs taken from openclipart.org


BUGS
====
If for whatever reason you like this and want to report a bug,
please do so. I'm a nice guy.
